# Theater Plays - Data analysis and Reporting with Excel 

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze and depict the outcomes of **Theater Plays** to assist Louise visualize how **plays** campaign did in relation to the Launch Date and Funding Goals.  The data was provided in Excel format therefore Excel was used with its available tools/features to search/filter/analyze the data and visualized in this report using Charts.

## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis of the data was performed using Excel functions and formulas.  Functions, such as *YEAR()* simplified the process of extracting the year from existing cells.  Formulas, such as *COUNTIFS()* were critical to extracting data from different columns based only on the required criteria.  The visualization was simplified by using Charts.  The tools and references provided where very helpful to assist with this challenge.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Although I feel that I did not run into Excel challenges, my personal challenge was trying to understand the project and requirements to ensure its success.  To overcome this personal challenge, or when things did not make sense, I had to re-read the challenge and then re-read certain sections within each deliverable, take notes and then reattempt the requested task(s).

## Results
Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The first conclusion that can be drawn about the outcome based on launch date is that May had the best outcome in relationship to the total successful, failure, canceled events.  The second conclusion that can be drawn is that based on the criteria used, there is no correlation amongst canceled events with successful and failed events.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
What I can conclude from the Outcomes based on Goals is that **Plays** projects with lower Goal amounts had better success then with higher Goal amounts.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
I don't see limitations with the provided dataset, but more on the learned calculations/formulas could be used to analyze the dataset in case there are outliers. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A possible table that can be created is the box plots.
